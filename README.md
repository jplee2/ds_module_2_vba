# Homework for Data Science Bootcamp - Module 2: VBA

In this assignment, I utilized VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

I created a script that looped through all the stocks for each quarter and produced the quarterly changes from opening to closing prices, as well as the percentage change of each quarter, and the total stock volumes.

I added functionality to my script to return the stocks with the greatest % change and then adjusted my code to enable it to run on every worksheet in the dataset.
